ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German-only project

Legacy version of *koalaSports Wichteln*. A secret santa app written in PHP which allows
participants to login via Steam. Restricts players to Steam accounts that are in a certain
Steam group. Uses an algorithm to draw players that configurably minimizes pairs
(2 participants who draw each other).

Requires a MySQL database.

## Notes
This is one of my first web programming projects ever. It is probably not all that good.
